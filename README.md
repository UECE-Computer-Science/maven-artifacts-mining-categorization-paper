# Estratégias para Categorização de Dependências: Análise de Tags, Diferenças e Automação em Ecossistemas de Software

## Overview and Goal
In this work, we conducted a systematic literature mapping to summarize the knowledge regarding the migration of legacy systems to the cloud. Additionally, we performed an exploratory analysis of discussions on Stack Overflow and other question-and-answer communities within the Stack Exchange network to gather professionals' perspectives on this topic and compare these perspectives with the knowledge found in the literature. The contributions of this study include identifying trends, patterns, advancements, gaps, challenges, and opportunities in the field of legacy system migration as reported in the literature. Most importantly, we developed a proof of concept for a decision support software tool using a Large Language Model (LLM) that provides targeted responses to questions about migrating legacy systems to the cloud, enhanced by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method.

## Research Questions
1. What are the challenges in migrating traditional systems to the cloud?
2. What are the opportunities in migrating traditional systems to the cloud?
3. What is the developer's perspective about the migration process?

## PICO

## PRISMA

## LLM for Decision Support Categorization

This proof of concept (PoC) project assists professionals in migrating legacy systems. The architecture involves two main components:

#### 1. LLM Enhancement via RAG Method
The LLM (Llama 2) is enhanced using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method, which retrieves relevant content from external studies to provide more accurate responses without altering the model's core.

#### 2. Q&A System for Migration Support
